# Elysia JS API Starter Template

A modern, fast, and scalable API starter template built with [ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/). Features comprehensive authentication, team management, and robust testing.

## 🚀 Features

- **Background Jobs & Queues**: Redis‑backed job system with retries, delays, rate limiting, and dashboard
- **Fast & Modern**: Built with ElysiaJS and Bun for exceptional performance
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with strict type checking
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure password hashing
- **Team Management**: Complete team and staff management system
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Testing**: 284 comprehensive tests with 99.3% pass rate
- **API Documentation**: Auto-generated Swagger documentation
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (JavaScript runtime)

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Install Bun

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### 2. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ICTGlobe/elysia-starter.git
cd elysia-starter

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Configure Environment

Edit the `.env` file with your configuration:

```bash
# Required: JWT secret for authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key

# Optional: JWT expiration time (default: 86400 seconds = 24 hours)
JWT_MAX_AGE=86400

# Database URL (default: SQLite file)
DATABASE_URL=file:./database.db
```

## 🗄️ Database Setup

### Generate Migrations

When you modify the database schema, generate new migrations:

```bash
bun run db:generate
```

### Run Migrations

Apply database migrations:

```bash
bun run db:migrate
```

### Seed Database

Populate the database with initial data:

```bash
bun run db:seed
```

### Database Studio

Open Drizzle Studio to view and edit data:

```bash
bun run studio
```

## 🧵 Background Jobs & Queues

This project includes a background job system inspired by Laravel queues, built with **BullMQ + Redis**.

### Key capabilities

- Redis‑backed durable queues
- Multiple queues (e.g. `default`, `emails`, `notifications`)
- Configurable concurrency per queue
- Per‑queue rate limiting
- Retries with exponential backoff
- Job execution timeouts
- Delayed (scheduled) jobs
- Graceful worker shutdown
- Web dashboard for monitoring and retries

### Running workers

Start the background workers in a separate process:

```bash
bun run queue:work
```

### Creating a job (CLI)

Use the built‑in CLI to scaffold and register jobs:

```bash
bun run make:job Example
```

This will:

- Create a new job class in `src/jobs/`
- Register it in `src/queue/job-handlers.ts`
- Enforce safe defaults (no overwrites, no duplicates)

---

### Creating a queue (CLI)

Use the CLI to scaffold and register new queues:

```bash
bun run make:queue emails --concurrency 2 --rate 10:60000
```

This will:

- Add the queue to `queue-config.ts`
- Register the queue in `queues.ts`
- Configure concurrency and rate limiting

---

### Dispatching a job

```ts
SendWelcomeEmail.dispatch({ userId });
```

### Dashboard

When the API is running, visit:

```
/admin/queues
```

For full documentation, see:

- `docs/queues-and-jobs.md`

---

## 🚀 Development

### Start Development Server

```bash
bun run dev
```

The server will start with hot reloading enabled. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your API.

### Production Build

```bash
bun run start
```

## 🧪 Testing

This project includes comprehensive test coverage with **284 total tests**:

- **Unit Tests** (175 tests): Service layer and utility functions
- **Feature Tests** (109 tests): API endpoints and integration tests

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Run only unit tests
bun run test:unit

# Run only feature tests
bun run test:feature
```
